As the description states, both of these files will be downloaded with `wget` to the same directory. I will assume the `.py` file needs the `.txt` file to run properly. 
Before running the `.py` file, lets `cat` into both files to see if there is anything that will be missed.

The `.txt` file seems to provide a seemingly useless string which most likely will be used in the `.py` file. `cat code.py` returns the code that will execute when the script is called and we can see that there is a variable 
`flag_enc` which creates a bunch of characters from hexadecimal. Right below this we see a function called `print_flag` which shows it needs a file called `codebook.txt` and then will take characters from this file and add them to the password. 
The password is then printed combing the `flag_enc` and `password` variables.

Now running the `code.py` file should give the flag.
