For this challenge we must use `netcat` to interact with a certain port which will contain the next step. 

Once connected we are greeted with a binary string and need to convert it within 45 seconds. This can be done quickly with an online converter. Even though for some reason it does say the answer in the line right above.

Then we get another string that is encoded using an octal format which can also be done with in online converter.

And finally a hex format that once entered returns the flag. This was also done with an online converter.
