I finished all of the general skills challenges to date but the last few really gave me issues so I decided not to document them as I basically just looked up the whole challenge rather than attempting to solve them myself. 

For now, I am mostly going to stop doing these CTFs although I found them extremely fun but it is time for me to get back to studying and preparing for my next tasks at hand. Hopefully I helped some out, maybe gave out some additional knowledge. Regardless, CTFs are a great way 
to expand skill sets and stay up to date with current techniques. I very much did enjoy my time doing them.
